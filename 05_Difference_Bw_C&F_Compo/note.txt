class component 
_____________________

a class component can also maintain a private internal state.
In simpler words. It can maintain some information which is private to that component and use that information to describe the user interface.


functional components
_______________________


functional components tend to be without any complicated logic and are mainly responsible for the user interface. 
Class components on the other hand, are a bit more feature rich.
They can maintain their own private data, also called as state.
They can contain complicated UI logic and most importantly they provide lifecycle hooks.
